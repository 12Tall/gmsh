This is the binary Software Development Kit (SDK) for Gmsh ${GMSH_VERSION}:

  Operating system: ${GMSH_OS} (${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME})
  C++ compiler: ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}
  C++ compiler ID: ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}
  C++ compiler version: ${CXX_COMPILER_VERSION}
  C++ compiler flags:${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO}
  Build options:${GMSH_CONFIG_OPTIONS}

SDK layout:

  lib/${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX}gmsh${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX}: shared Gmsh library
  lib/gmsh.py: Python module
  bin/gmsh: gmsh executable (linked with the shared Gmsh library)
  include/gmsh.h: C++ API header
  include/gmshc.h: C API header
  share/doc/gmsh/demos/api : API usage example in C++, Python and C

The C API (and the Python bindings, which use the C API internally) should work
with most compilers. The C++ API will only work if your compiler has the same
ABI as the compiler used to build this SDK.
