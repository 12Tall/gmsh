This is the Software Development Kit (SDK) for Gmsh, an automatic
three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and
post-processing facilities.

Gmsh is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. See the
share/doc/gmsh/LICENSE.txt and share/doc/gmsh/CREDITS.txt files for more
information.

The dynamic Gmsh library is located in the lib/ directory, as is the Python API
(gmsh.py) module. The C++ API (gmsh.h) and C API (gmshc.h) header files are
located in the include/ directory. The bin/ directory contains a full-featured
Gmsh executable linked with the dynamic library.

Examples on how to use the Gmsh API from C++, C or Python are provided in the
share/doc/gmsh/demos/api/ directory.
