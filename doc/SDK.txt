This is the binary Software Development Kit (SDK) for Gmsh ${GMSH_VERSION}:

  * Operating system: ${GMSH_OS} (${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME})
  * C++ compiler: ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}
  * C++ compiler ID: ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}
  * C++ compiler version: ${CXX_COMPILER_VERSION}
  * C++ compiler flags:${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO}
  * Build options:${GMSH_CONFIG_OPTIONS}

Gmsh is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License: see
share/doc/gmsh/LICENSE.txt and share/doc/gmsh/CREDITS.txt. For additional Gmsh
resources, see http://gmsh.info.

SDK layout:

  * lib/${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX}gmsh${CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX}: shared Gmsh library
  * lib/gmsh.py: Python module
  * bin/gmsh: gmsh executable (linked with the shared Gmsh library)
  * include/gmsh.h: C++ API header
  * include/gmshc.h: C API header
  * share/doc/gmsh/demos/api : API examples in C++, Python and C

Notes:

  * The C API (and the Python bindings, which use the C API internally) should
    work with most compilers.

  * The C++ API will only work if your compiler has the same ABI as the compiler
    used to build this SDK. The SDKs compiled with GNU g++ currently use g++ 4;
    you will need to specify "-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" if you use g++ 5 or
    newer.
